                // typing a new string, we make use of the state delegate. However, the state delegate we
                // use here is slightly different than the one we used in [StateActivity]. Here, we make
                // use of the savedInstanceState composable. Read one to learn more about the difference.

                // Reacting to state changes is the core behavior of Compose. Any composable that reads the
                // value of the textValue field will recompose whenever this value is changed. In this
                // example, since the TextField is reading the value from the textValue value, and
                // that's also the value that we update as the user types (through the onValueChange
                // lambda), this composable is redrawn and updated with the latest value.

                // Since we are trying to retain the state even in a scenario when the process that our
                // app was running in is shut down or when the activity is recreated (like in the case of
                // orientation changes), we use the savedInstanceState composable. It's created for
                // supporting the exact use case.

                // Now you may ask that why isn't this the default behavior of the state composable itself
                // and why is there a separate savedInstanceState composable? Great question!
                // The main reason is that this has a limit on how much data you can store inside it and
                // is meant to only support data with a size less than 500kb
                // (https://stackoverflow .com/questions/8552514/is-there-any-limit-of-bundle-in-android)
                // Thus you should be careful about what data you store inside.

/**
 * Android Studio lets you preview your composable functions within the IDE itself, instead of

 * can preview all your custom components(read composable functions) from the comforts of the IDE.
 * The main restriction is, the composable function must not take any parameters. If your composable
 * function requires a parameter, you can simply wrap your component inside another composable
 * function that doesn't take any parameters and call your composable function with the appropriate
 * params. Also, don't forget to annotate it with @Preview & @Composable annotations.

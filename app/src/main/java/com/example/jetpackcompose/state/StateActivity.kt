 * In this example, we are making use of a data class called [CounterState] that's annotated with

 * example above. Both the state composable & the Model annotation do the same thing - they work
 * as a mechanism to allow efficient recomposition & hold state that allows other composables to
 * observe the state to recompose whenever the value is updated. You would want to use the @Model
 * annotation whenever your model class is trying to class multiple values and just use the state
 * composable like in the example above whenever you want to track a single value.

 * The main restriction is, the composable function must not take any parameters. If your composable
 * function requires a parameter, you can simply wrap your component inside another composable
 * function that doesn't take any parameters and call your composable function with the appropriate
 * params. Also, don't forget to annotate it with @Preview & @Composable annotations.

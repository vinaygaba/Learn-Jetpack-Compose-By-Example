/**
 * Android Studio lets you preview your composable functions within the IDE itself, instead of
 * needing to download the app to an Android device or emulator. This is a fantastic feature as you
 * can preview all your custom components(read composable functions) from the comforts of the IDE.
 * The main restriction is, the composable function must not take any parameters. If your composable
 * function requires a parameter, you can simply wrap your component inside another composable
 * function that doesn't take any parameters and call your composable function with the appropriate
 * params. Also, don't forget to annotate it with @Preview & @Composable annotations.

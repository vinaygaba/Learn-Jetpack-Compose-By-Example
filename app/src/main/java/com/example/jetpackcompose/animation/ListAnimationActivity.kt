// We represent a Composable function by annotating it with the @Composable annotation. Composable
// functions can only be called from within the scope of other composable functions. We should

// built up of smaller composable functions.

    // Reacting to state changes is the core behavior of Compose. You will notice a couple new 
    // keywords that are compose related - remember & mutableStateListOf.remember{} is a helper 
    // composable that calculates the value passed to it only during the first composition. It then 
    // returns the same value for every subsequent composition. Next, you can think of 
    // mutableStateListOf as an observable list where updates to this variable will redraw all 
    // the composable functions that access it. We don't need to explicitly subscribe at all. Any 
    // composable that reads the value of deletedPersonList will be recomposed any time the value 
    // changes. This ensures that only the composables that depend on this will be redraw while the 
    // rest remain unchanged. This ensures efficiency and is a performance optimization. It 
    // is inspired from existing frameworks like React.

    // We use this variable to hold the list of all Person objects that are deleted from the list
    // below.
    val deletedPersonList = remember { mutableStateListOf<Person>() }

    // LazyColumn is a vertically scrolling list that only composes and lays out the currently
    // visible items. This is very similar to what RecyclerView tries to do as it's more optimized
    // than the VerticalScroller.

    // In addition, we pass a modifier to the LazyColumn composable. You can think of
    // Modifiers as implementations of the decorators pattern that  are used to modify the 
    // composable that its applied to. In this example, we configure the LazyColumn to 
    // occupy the entire available width using Modifier.fillMaxWidth().

                // AnimatedVisibility is a pre-defined composable that automatically animates the 
                // appearance and disappearance of it's content. This makes it super easy to animated
                // things like insertion/deletion of a list element. The visible property tells the
                // AnimatedVisibility about whether to show the composable that it wraps (in this case, 
                // the Card that you see below). This is where you can add logic about whether a certain 
                // element needs to either be shown or not. In our case, we want to show an element, only
                // if its not a part of the deletedPersonList list. As this list changes and a given 
                // person is either shown or hidden from the screen, the "enter" and "exit" animations 
                // are called for a given item. AnimatedVisibility also let's you specify the enter and 
                // exit animation so that you have full control over how you'd like to animate it's enter
                // or exit. In the example below, since I also added functionality to delete an item, I 
                // customize the exit animation to be an animation that shrinks vertically and gave the 
                // animation a duration of 1000ms.

/**
 * Android Studio lets you preview your composable functions within the IDE itself, instead of

 * can preview all your custom components(read composable functions) from the comforts of the IDE.
 * The main restriction is, the composable function must not take any parameters. If your composable
 * function requires a parameter, you can simply wrap your component inside another composable
 * function that doesn't take any parameters and call your composable function with the appropriate
 * params. Also, don't forget to annotate it with @Preview & @Composable annotations.

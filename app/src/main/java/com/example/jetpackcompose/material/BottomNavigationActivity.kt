// Android Studio lets you preview your composable functions within the IDE itself, instead of
// needing to download the app to an Android device or emulator. This is a fantastic feature as you
// can preview all your custom components(read composable functions) from the comforts of the IDE.
// The main restriction is, the composable function must not take any parameters. If your composable
// function requires a parameter, you can simply wrap your component inside another composable
// function that doesn't take any parameters and call your composable function with the appropriate
// params. Also, don't forget to annotate it with @Preview & @Composable annotations.

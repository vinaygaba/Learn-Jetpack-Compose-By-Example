    // that is used for holding a state value in this composable for representing the current
    // value of whether the checkbox is checked. Any composable that reads the value of "selectedIndices"
    // will be recomposed any time the value changes. This ensures that only the composables that
    // depend on this will be redraw while the rest remain unchanged. This ensures efficiency and
    // is a performance optimization. It is inspired from existing frameworks like React.

    // Box to occupy the entire available width using the Modifier.fillMaxSize() modifier and 
    // also give it a padding of 4 dp.

        // overflows to more rows.

//                // accustomed to on Android.

/**
 * Android Studio lets you preview your composable functions within the IDE itself, instead of
 * needing to download the app to an Android device or emulator. This is a fantastic feature as you
 * can preview all your custom components(read composable functions) from the comforts of the IDE.
 * The main restriction is, the composable function must not take any parameters. If your composable
 * function requires a parameter, you can simply wrap your component inside another composable
 * function that doesn't take any parameters and call your composable function with the appropriate
 * params. Also, don't forget to annotate it with @Preview & @Composable annotations.

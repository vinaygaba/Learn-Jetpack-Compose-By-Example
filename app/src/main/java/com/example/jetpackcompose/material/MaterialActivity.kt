    // corners and apply a modifier.

    // You can think of Modifiers as implementations of the decorators pattern that are used to
    // modify the composable that its applied to. In the example below, we add a padding of
    // 8dp to the Card composable. In addition, we configure it out occupy the entire available
    // width using the Modifier.fillMaxWidth() modifier.
    Card(shape = RoundedCornerShape(4.dp), modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp) + Modifier.fillMaxWidth()) {
        // Clickable wraps the child composable and enables it to react to a click through the
        // onClick callback similar to the onClick listener that we are accustomed to on Android.
        // In order to show a ripple effect, we make use of the Modifier.ripple modifier with the
        // default values.
        Clickable(onClick = {}, modifier = Modifier.ripple(bounded = true)) {
            // Box is a predefined convenience composable that allows you to apply common
            // draw & layout logic.
            Box(backgroundColor = Color.LightGray, shape = RoundedCornerShape(4.dp)) {
                // The Text composable is pre-defined by the Compose UI library; you can use this
                // composable to render text on the screen
                Text(text = "Click Me", modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp), style = TextStyle(
                    fontSize = TextUnit.Companion.Sp(12), fontFamily = FontFamily.Serif
                ))

/**
 * Android Studio lets you preview your composable functions within the IDE itself, instead of
 * needing to download the app to an Android device or emulator. This is a fantastic feature as you
 * can preview all your custom components(read composable functions) from the comforts of the IDE.
 * The main restriction is, the composable function must not take any parameters. If your composable
 * function requires a parameter, you can simply wrap your component inside another composable
 * function that doesn't take any parameters and call your composable function with the appropriate
 * params. Also, don't forget to annotate it with @Preview & @Composable annotations.
